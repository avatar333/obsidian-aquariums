#### Introduction

- For this build, I want to focus on the use of an aquasoil of some sort (ADA, Langa etc) combined with a root fertilizer (like Osmocote) to grow stem plants which will benefit from a nutrient rich substrate and not just nutrients from the water column.
- The aquasoil + root ferts will be placed in media
